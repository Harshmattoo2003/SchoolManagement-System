            First of all, yes you need to download all parts. In case you will not download all parts then it won’t have all the game data files that are required to extract the game resulting in corrupt file error. The reason we upload big games in parts is to assure that users can easily download them quickly. If big games are not divided into parts, downloading will take a lot of time.

            <h6 className="f11"><b>6. Do i need to extract all parts and can i rename game parts files?<br/>Ans. </b>
                 No, you don’t need to extract all parts, just keep all parts in one folder and extract part 1, so all parts can be extracted automatically. On the other hand, you should not rename parts files of the game, because if any part gets renamed the main file won’t recognized that part, which could get the file corrupted and you will not be able to play the game
            </h6><br/>
            <h6 className="f11"><b>7. My WinRAR keep showing corrupt error while extracting the game?<br/>Ans. </b>
            It mostly occurs because you’re using an old version or some new version of WinRAR which is not compatible with our WinRAR file version. Please use Winrar 5.01 for the best and smooth extraction without any errors.

            <h6 className="f11"><b>8. When I install the game my anti-virus or anti-malware program pops-up and shows the game file as a virus. Does your game has a virus?<br/>Ans. </b>
            All anti-virus programs get paid to stop crack games, so when anti-virus detects cracked game or cracked game setup, it deletes the crack file or abort setup before the installation process ends. All you need to do is disable your anti-virus before extracting or installing any game and then re-enable it after the first launch or add the crack files or launchers of the games in exclusion list of your anti-virus. (see below, if you don’t know how to add crack or launchers in exclusion list by different anti-viruses in detailed).
            </h6><br/>
            <h6 className="f11"><b>9. Why should I disable anti-virus before extracting or installing any game, I’m worried that it can damage my PC by infecting it with a virus or malware?<br/>Ans. </b>
            First of all, we scan all files using Avast Premium Antivirus to make sure that it doesn’t contain any virus or malware. Then we test, and play all these games to give you 100% working and safe games. There is no need to worry. The reason you should disable your anti-virus or malware program before extracting is that if your anti-malware program blocks or otherwise interferes with a game installation, you may end up with an installation failure or error. Disabling or exiting the anti-virus software isn’t the same thing as uninstalling it completely. All you need to do is temporarily turn it off during the installation of any game and then re-enable it after the first launch.
